# Misc C Projects

This is a collection of miscellaneous projects I'm trying in C while learning more about the language and low-level systems development.

Some of the code I create herein is _not_ based on viewing or transcribing other source codes/repositories.

Whether the projects are copies of things I've done in the past, or some trivial computations, this repository will contain all of the loose bits in a disarray.


### List of "Projects"

- __FIBONACCI__: Outputs the _Nth_ index into the Fibonacci Series (index starts at 1, not 0), by `./fibonacci N`.
```
[me@device c-projects]$ NUM=35; for x in `seq 1 $NUM`; do ./first-app "$x" 1; done; printf "\n";
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765 10946 17711 28657 46368 75025 121393 196418 317811 514229 832040 1346269 2178309 3524578 5702887
